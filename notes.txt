#1 0.32, pa on, 60mm/s
#2 pa off, tightened up BMG screw, retractions 60mm/s
#3 pa on, turned down voltage to 0.8 rms on x and y
#4 adjust e accelerations in slicer to 1500
#5 turned down x y acceleration to 1000
#6 increased rms to extruder to 85%
#7 try printing at a different layer height 0.24 - hypothesis it can't keep up with volume which doesn't make much sense
#8 move the gear on the extruder stepper - 1.5mm away from collar
#9 up flow by 5% the flow test seems to indicate - slightly underextruded at 100%
#10 up flow by 10% 

TODO

- decrease RMS back to 80%
- turn accelerations back up
- run retractions test
